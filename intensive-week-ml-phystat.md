As part of the special "transverse program" of PSL, we organize with
the help of PSL a special 1 week course on the topic of "Machine Learning - Statistical Physics". This course is open in priority to Master 2
students of PSL. It is also open to other students (Master and PhD)
and researchers, subject to availability.

_Important:_ Master students should check with their master's
administration if this course can be used to validate one of their
master course.

Dates and location
============================

**Dates** 11th of April - 15th of  April, 2022

**Location** ENS-Ulm, Physics Department. 


**Organizers** Francis Bach and Guilio Biroli

Pre-register to the Courses
============================

[Pre-registration is free but mandatory](https://forms.gle/7NgBcAuGsPKKEiPq7).  Everyone will have to
organize their own lunch. There are restaurants and food stores within
walking distance of the campus. Both on-site and remote work will be
offered, but teachers will only answer to on-site questions.
Registration for on site work is limited to 25 listeners.  PSL
students have priority if they pre-register before January 31st.

Courses Content
============================

The aim of the Machine Learning - Statistical Physics intensive week
is to present methods, ideas and connections between these two fields.
In fact, methods and ideas developed in statistical physics of
disordered systems can provide additional new tools to analyze the
high-dimensional non-convex problems that emerge in machine learning.
 
During the first part of the week, after a general introduction, we
will focus on simple machine learning problems and analyze them by
rigorous and exact (but non-rigorous) statistical physics method. This
will be helpful to concrete present some of the connections between ML
and statistical physics. In particular, we will introduce the replica
method which has proven very useful in physics and other branches of
science, as recognized by the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics to Giorgio
Parisi. The first part is meant to be « hands-on » and it will include
problem classes.
 
The second part will be devoted to more realistic models and current
research questions, such as the Double Descent phenomenon and Convex
and Non-Convex Optimization.

The schedule will consists in two sessions per day of 2 hours each
from Monday to Friday (possibly ending Friday morning).
