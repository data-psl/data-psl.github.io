As part of the special "transverse program" of PSL, the [DHAI group](https://dhai-seminar.github.io/) organizes with the help of PSL a special 1 week course on the topic of "Digital Humanities Meet Artificial Intelligence". This course is open in priority to Master 2 students of PSL. It is also open to other students (Master and PhD) and researchers, subject to availability.

This intensive training will cover theoretical, numerical and applicative topics at the intersection between these two fields. The structure of the course will be quite innovative, since it will interplay theoretical course, practical sessions with computer labs and projects in small groups.

_Important:_ Master students should check with their master's administration if this course can be used to validate one of their master course.

Dates and location
============================

Dates: March 29 to April 2.

Location: TBA

Pre-register to the Courses
============================

[Pre-registration is free but mandatory](https://forms.gle/qQFKg8FH3BLsEVxM6).

PSL students have priority if they pre-register before January 31st.

Courses Content
============================

This week-long course will be split into three types of classes: theory, practice and project. During the project session, students will work in small groups toward a case study of practical importance. The final examination of the course will be a short presentation of the projects.

_List of  courses:_

- Course 1: [Léa Saint-Raymond](https://u-paris10.academia.edu/LéaSaintRaymond), _Quantitative data analysis and cartography_.
- Course 2: [Mathieu Aubry](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~aubrym/), _Computer vision for the humanities_.
- Course 3: [Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel](https://artlas.huma-num.fr/en/staff-member/beatrice-joyeux-prunel-2/), _History of art and AI_.
- Course 4: [Jean-Baptiste Camps](http://www.chartes.psl.eu/fr/jean-baptiste-camps) and [Thierry Poibeau](https://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/membres/direction/thierry-poibeau/), _NLP for the humanities_.
- Course 5: [Ségolène Albouy and Matthieu Husson](https://syrte.obspm.fr/spip/science/histoire/membres-de-l-equipe/article/matthieu-husson), _History of astronomy and AI_.


_The practical sessions will feature:_
- Python programming for AI.
- Digital Sources and Tools for the Humanities.

_Examples of projects include:_
- Computer vision and digital heritage.
- Computational table exploration for Alfonsine astronomy.
- Automatic discovery of chronologic and geographic circulation of artistic styles.
- Improving the GROBID software for semantic description of semi-structured data.

**Course 5: [Ségolène Albouy and Matthieu Husson](https://syrte.obspm.fr/spip/science/histoire/membres-de-l-equipe/article/matthieu-husson), _History of astronomy and AI_:**

- _History of astronomy and AI: an overview:_ From Delambre (Histoire de l’astronomie ancienne, Paris,1817) through Neugebauer (History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy, Berlin, 1975), the history of astronomy produced in Europe has a long relation to quantitative methods. Towards the end of the 1960s, this association intensified with the use of computers to assess ancient observations and computation methods (Poulle and Gingerich, 1968). Today, the rise of digital humanities and its coupling with AI opens new possibilities explored by different research projects. Based on a historiographical overview, this session will illustrate the current challenges emerging at the interface of history of astronomy, AI and Digital humanities with respect to artificial vision, text analysis and reenactment of ancient computations. We will discuss how AI can tackle ambitious challenges relating to issues as diverse as mathematical questions, genealogy of sources, transcription, diagram vectorization, and more.
- _A step aside:_$ from document to data: Based on various examples from the previous session, we will explore how different datasets, exploitable by artificial intelligence algorithms, can be built to address, from historical sources, questions of various nature. We will evoke the stakes related to the transformation of a material document to its various digital representations: from the point of view of its acquisition, its modeling, its encoding, its “augmentation” or even its “simulation”. Finally, we will discuss what constitutes pertinent training datasets from a human sciences perspective as well as a machine learning perspective.
