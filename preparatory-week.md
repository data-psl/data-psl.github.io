This year, the transverse program for data sciences of PSL proposes two preparatory weeks :
- The first  (starting the 30th of August)  focuses on basics in math and data science. The students will follow it **remotely and autonomously**. For each part, video lectures, exercise sheets and lab
sessions (Python notebooks) will be provided.
- The second week (6 to  11 Sept. 2021) provides   an introduction to machine learning, data managment, and the  ethics of data science.   

Both weeks are open to all master and PhD students from PSL. Subject
to availabilities, students from other universities can also
attend. The registration is free but mandatory.  See the two links
below, one for each week.

Course materials
============================

Slides and suplementary materials for the lecture and numerics [are available from here](https://github.com/data-psl/lectures2020).

Practical information
============================

The course will be given on a Discord server. We recommend that you install [discord](https://discord.com/). The link to the server will be given to registered students.

The afternoon are dedicated to practical sessions using Python. Students will be on their own under a weak supervision from the teachers. Students can use the discord server chat to communicate, share information, codes, data and help each other during these session.

These practical sessions will necessitate the use of Python 3 with the standard Scipy ecosystem, Scikit-learn and Pytorch. They will make use of Jupyter notebooks. The easiest way to proceed is to have a gmail account and make use of a remote [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the notebooks. If you are not confortable with this, or if you want to run the code locally, you need to install the requested python package, preferably using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

Teachers
============================

- [Pierre Ablin](https://pierreablin.com/) (ENS)
- [Mathieu Blondel](http://mblondel.org/) (Google Brain)
- [Arthur Mensch](https://www.amensch.fr/) (ENS)
- [Dario Colazzo](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~colazzo/) (Dauphine).
