This year, the transverse program for data sciences of PSL proposes two preparatory weeks :
- **The preparatory week on basics** in math and data science (starting the 29th of August). The students will follow it **remotely and autonomously**. For each part, video lectures, exercise sheets and lab
sessions (Python notebooks) will be provided.
- **The preparatory week on machine learning, bigdata, and  ethics**  (5 to  10 Sept. 2022) 

Both weeks are open to all master and PhD students from PSL. Subject
to availabilities, students from other universities can also
attend. The registration is free but mandatory.  See the two links
below, one for each week.

# Preparatory week on basics (remote)

This first preparatory week will "start" on Monday, August 29. By the way you can start before: all you need is your moodle account (see the section on registration). 
The students will follow it remotely and autonomously. For each of the five parts, video lectures, exercise sheets and lab
sessions under the form of Python notebooks will be provided. For each part, the theoretical
content (lectures and exercises) should represent about a half day of work (around four hours),
and the lab session also.

**It is mandatory to follow this week before the advanced one !!**

## Pre-registration

[You can pre-register here to the course](https://forms.gle/fjPQ9jV8EtTuGymx6).

PSL students have priority if they pre-register before August 15th. 

To have access to the moddle, you need to register before August the 20th. 

## Expected roadmap

With this organization in mind, the schedule is as follows :
- Reza Hatami: Functions and sequences 
- Gwendoline de Bie: Basics of linear algebra
- Pierre Ablin Differential: calculus and PCA
- Madalina Olteanu: Statistics
- Pierre Senellart: Databases


## Q&A sessions

In addition, sessions of questions and answers will be organized : the teachers of the first
four parts will make themselves available through Teams in the afternoon, during two hours, and will answer the
questions of the students.

## Course materials


[Slides and suplementary materials for the lecture and numerics are available.](https://data-psl.github.io/lectures2022/). 

## Practical information


The afternoon are dedicated to practical sessions using Python. Students will be on their own under a weak supervision from the teachers. Students can use the [discord server](https://discord.gg/ZcBReVVbdZ) chat to communicate, share information, codes, data and help each other during these session.

These practical sessions will necessitate the use of Python 3 with the standard Scipy ecosystem, Scikit-learn and Pytorch. They will make use of Jupyter notebooks. The easiest way to proceed is to have a gmail account and make use of a remote [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the notebooks. If you are not confortable with this, or if you want to run the code locally, you need to install the requested python package, preferably using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
