As part of the special "transverse program" of PSL, the [DHAI group](https://dhai-seminar.github.io/) organizes with the help of PSL a special 1 week course on the topic of "Digital Humanities Meet Artificial Intelligence". This course is open in priority to Master 2 students of PSL. It is also open to other students (Master and PhD) and researchers, subject to availability.

This intensive training will cover theoretical, numerical and applicative topics at the intersection between these two fields. The structure of the course will be quite innovative, since it will interplay theoretical course, practical sessions with computer labs and projects in small groups.

_Important:_ Master students should check with their master's administration if this course can be used to validate one of their master course.
