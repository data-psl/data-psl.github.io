As part of the special "transverse program" of PSL, we organize with
the help of PSL a special 1 week course on the topic of "Computer vision and time series analysis for Physics and Engineering". This course is open in priority to Master 2
students of PSL. It is also open to other students (Master and PhD)
and researchers, subject to availability.

_Important:_ Master students should check with their master's
administration if this course can be used to validate one of their
master course.

Dates and location
============================

**Dates** 28th March - 1st April, 2022

**Location** Parisant√© Campus, 10 Rue d'Oradour-sur-Glane, 92130 Issy-les-Moulineaux
