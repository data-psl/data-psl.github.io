As part of the special "transverse program" of PSL, the [DHAI group](https://dhai-seminar.github.io/) organizes with the help of PSL a special 1 week course on the topic of "Digital Humanities Meet Artificial Intelligence". This course is open in priority to Master 2 students of PSL. It is also open to other students (Master and PhD) and researchers, subject to availability.

This intensive training will cover theoretical, numerical and applicative topics at the intersection between these two fields. The structure of the course will be quite innovative, since it will interplay theoretical course, practical sessions with computer labs and projects in small groups.

_Important:_ Master students should check with their master's administration if this course can be used to validate one of their master course.

Dates and location
============================

Dates: March 28 to April 1.

Location: FRESK (10 rue d’Oradour-sur-Glane à Issy-les-Moulineaux, 92130)

Pre-register to the Courses
============================

[Pre-registration is free but mandatory](https://forms.gle/xzJikS7YF1B2hrrk9)

PSL students have priority if they pre-register before January 31st.

Courses Content
============================

This week-long course will be split into three types of classes: theory, practice and project. During the project session, students will work in small groups toward a case study of practical importance. The final examination of the course will be a short presentation of the projects.

_List of  courses:_ 


- Course 1: _Quantitative Data Analysis and Cartography_ ([Léa Saint-Raymond](https://u-paris10.academia.edu/LéaSaintRaymond) and Mathieu Rimet-Meille).
- Course 2: _Computer Vision for the Humanities_ ([Mathieu Aubry](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~aubrym/)).
- Course 3: _Introduction to Natural Language Processing_ ([Thierry Poibeau](https://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/membres/direction/thierry-poibeau/)).
- Course 4: _DH/AI Tools and Astronomy_ ([Matthieu Husson, Ségolène Albouy, and Tristan Dot](https://syrte.obspm.fr/spip/science/histoire/membres-de-l-equipe/article/matthieu-husson)).

_The practical sessions will feature:_

Detailed contents
============================

**Course 1: _Quantitative data analysis and cartography_, [Léa Saint-Raymond](https://u-paris10.academia.edu/LéaSaintRaymond) and Mathieu Rimet-Meille:**

This course offers training in computational data analysis. Students will receive the following theoretical and practical basics:
- Basic statistics and econometrics
- Factor analysis
- Network Analysis
- Cartography

At the end of this training, students will be able to explore a corpus of data and analyze it from a quantitative and relational perspective. They will master the following software:
- R
- QGis
- Gephi
- and, for the exploratory part, Palladio


**Course 2: _Computer vision for the humanities_, [Mathieu Aubry](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~aubrym/):**

- Introduction to Computer Vision with a specific focus on Deep Learning. We will introduce the basic principles of Machine Learning and Neural Networks for Computer Vision applications. We will outline the specific difficulties of applications to historical and artistic data, standard use cases in digital humanity (image search, document segmentation, image recognition) and examples of specific projects on [artwork price prediction](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3347175), [historical watermark recognition](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~shenx/Watermark/), [pattern recognition](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~shenx/ArtMiner/) and [discovery in artwork datasets](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~shenx/ArtMiner/).


**Course 3: _Introduction to Natural Language Processing_, [Thierry Poibeau](https://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/membres/direction/thierry-poibeau/):**

- Natural language processing (NLP) is now everywhere and has  attained a level of performance which makes it usable in practical contexts, especially for digital humanities projects. During this course, we will see a mix of theoretical and practical issues related to NLP. We will see why NLP is hard, and why recent approaches based on machine learning have made it possible to get efficient and robust modules, usable in digital humanities projects. Lastly, we will show practical implementations, making it possible to used advanced techniques at a reduced cost (from a computational point of view) for different tasks: part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and parsing, among others.

- Related project: _Exploring the Twittersphere of the French presidential election_, Armin Pournaki: We will learn how to design a sensible search query and collect Twitter data about the French 2022 presidential election. We will explore the data using interactive network visualizations which give a structural overview of the debate's opinion clusters and their main actors. The textual content shared by these opinion groups will then be analyzed using natural language processing methods that you got to know in your theoretical course. This data exploration will allow us to generate hypotheses about the campaigning mechanisms of political actors on online social media.


**Course 4: _DH/AI Tools and Astronomy_, [Matthieu Husson, Ségolène Albouy, and Tristan Dot](https://syrte.obspm.fr/spip/science/histoire/membres-de-l-equipe/article/matthieu-husson):**

- _History of astronomy and AI: an overview:_ From Delambre (Histoire de l’astronomie ancienne, Paris,1817) through Neugebauer (History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy, Berlin, 1975), the history of astronomy produced in Europe has a long relation to quantitative methods. Towards the end of the 1960s, this association intensified with the use of computers to assess ancient observations and computation methods (Poulle and Gingerich, 1968). Today, the rise of digital humanities and its coupling with AI opens new possibilities explored by different research projects. Based on a historiographical overview, this session will illustrate the current challenges emerging at the interface of history of astronomy, AI and Digital humanities with respect to artificial vision, text analysis and reenactment of ancient computations. We will discuss how AI can tackle ambitious challenges relating to issues as diverse as mathematical questions, genealogy of sources, transcription, diagram vectorization, and more.
- _A step aside:_ from document to data: Based on various examples from the previous session, we will explore how different datasets, exploitable by artificial intelligence algorithms, can be built to address, from historical sources, questions of various nature. We will evoke the stakes related to the transformation of a material document to its various digital representations: from the point of view of its acquisition, its modeling, its encoding, its “augmentation” or even its “simulation”. Finally, we will discuss what constitutes pertinent training datasets from a human sciences perspective as well as a machine learning perspective.
