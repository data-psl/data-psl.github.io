# Aims and scope
The goal of the intensive weeks organized by the Transverse Program
DATA of PSL is to share during one week new research topics that require
interactions between machine learning/datascience and an other
scientific field. A week is organized around courses that bring
students with different backgrounds to work together on real problems
involving data.





# Upcoming weeks in spring 2022

The list of intensive weeks for spring 2022:


- [Digital Humanities Meet Artificial Intelligence (week of the 28th of March)](../intensive-week-dhai-2022)

The dedicated web pages will be set up soon. For some of them you can take a look to the *past editions* below to a have details.
For the two new intensive weeks, here is a quick overview.

## Statistical Physics and Machine Learning (week of the 11th of April)
Organized by **Francis Bach** and **Guilio Biroli**
- Upgrade in Physics and Machine Learning
- Modeling from both sides (Math and Physics)
- Statistical learning, from linear regression to over-parametrized models
- Convex and non-convex optimization
The course will be given by Francis Bach, Guilio Biroli and Stephane d'Ascoli.
The week will take place at ENS in the Physics Department.



## Computer Vision and Time series analysis for Physics and Engineering
Organizing by David Ryckelynck and Alexandre Allauzen
- Upgrade in Physics (E. Hachem) and Machine Learning (David Arturo Amor Quiroz)
- Computer vision (I. Laptev)
- Deep classifiers and digital twins (D. Ryckelynck)
- Auto-encoders for model reduction (D. Ryckelynck)
- Deep Learning for time series (M. Labeau)
- Multi-scale modeling of materials (F. Fritzen)
- Reinforcement learning in engineering (E. Hachem)


The course will take place at the  PariSant√© Campus, PSL University.  **Come with your laptop !**
