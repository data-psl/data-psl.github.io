# Aims and scope
The goal of the intensive weeks organized by the Program
DATA of PSL is to share during one week new research topics that require
interactions between machine learning/datascience and an other
scientific field. A week is organized around courses that bring
students with different backgrounds to work together on real problems
involving data.
