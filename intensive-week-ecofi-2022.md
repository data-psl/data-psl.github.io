As part of the special "transverse program" DATA of PSL, we organize the Eco/Finance AI summer school. You want to learn: 
- How AI can interact with economics and finance ?
- How to build machine learning models from data ?
- What is the connection between causality and machine learning ? 
- What can we learn from texts (Natural Language Processing) and images (Computer Vision) ? 
The goal of this summer school is to introduced recent and important tools from data science that can  address issues in the fields of economics and finance. This week  is composed of  livestreamed lectures and lab sessions to provide participants the starter skills. 



_Important:_ Master and PhD students should check with their administration if this course can be validated within their programme.
